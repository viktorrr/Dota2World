            <h3>Heroes</h3>
            <p>Heroes are the essential element of Dota 2, as the course of the game is dependent on their intervention. Players are split into two teams of 5, and can select a Hero from a selection panel. Heroes all have different play styles that stem from unique abilities and combinations of attributes. Over the course of the game, Heroes will accumulate experience. Once a Hero has enough experience, they will level up, making them more powerful than before and allowing them to level up new abilities. Most Heroes have a distinct role that defines how they can affect the battlefield, though many Heroes can perform two or more of these Roles.</p>

These Heroes have high attack speed and Armor, and focus on using their regular attacks and any Items they have, but can fall back on their abilities in a pinch. Agility Heroes will often be played as carry and gank roles, because of how well they scale. </p>

                    <p><strong>Intelligence Heroes</strong> are masters of spells and abilities. They tend to have larger Mana pools, and much greater Mana regeneration than other Heroes. Because of this, they often rely on their abilities to help allies and harm enemies, rather than physical attacks. Most Intelligence heroes are fragile and are also easy to kill.</p>
